KaladinX (a handle, that's all)

This is my GitHub. Iâ€™ve worked in social media marketing for yearsâ€”campaigns, content, that sort of thing.

Current Focus:

Studying python. js, css, html etc...

Working on a couple projects to get the hang of it.

Projects are mostly my own interests for the moment, nothing grandious.

nothing wrong with grandious.

If you find something interesting here, your probably my friend. I you don't...well

you might be my friend anyways.
